Email remains one of the most effective channels for communicating with users, whether you're sending transactional messages, marketing campaigns, or important notifications. For Dart and Flutter developers looking to integrate robust email capabilities into their applications, this Plunk library offers a comprehensive solution that's easy to use and packed with features.

[Plunk](https://www.useplunk.com) is a modern email platform designed specifically for SaaS applications. It provides powerful tools for sending transactional emails, managing contacts, and running email marketing campaigns. The plunk package is a Dart client that makes it easy to integrate with the Plunk API in your Dart or Flutter applications.

The `plunk` package is a REST client for the Plunk email platform for SaaS. This client is based on the published [Plunk API](https://docs.useplunk.com/api-reference).

The Plunk REST Client is maintained by [DartFoundry](https://dartfoundry.com) where it is used by the Hypermodern AI platform and products to send emails on behalf of partners and to customers.
